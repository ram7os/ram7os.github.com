title: Trying out Bootstrap
---

Thanks to @nhoss2 for [jekyll-bootstrap](http://nhoss2.github.com/jekyll-bootstrap/). I get to have a nicer design out of the box rather than the plain HTML in the first version. I tried out octopress.org to get a built-in design, but had to rebuild ruby via rvm too many times for it to work. Right now, jekyll's simplicity is kept, so I'm looking forward to working on [Bootstrap](http://bootstrap.io/Demo/) for this blog's design.
